# Simple-Perceptron
This is a simple C program that uses perceptron to learn simple boolean functions
such as AND, OR, NAND or NOR. Made with information obtained from Machine Learning by Tom M. Mitchell.

It works with 1 (true) and -1 (false) as input for dataset (input nodes and target output).

Runs on C99, compiled using gcc.
